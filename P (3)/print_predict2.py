##### Predict ##### 

# This is a Python comment
# A Python comment must start with a #

# Task 1 - Study the lines of code below 
# Task 2 - Make some observations/generalizations about how to use the print ( ) function in Python
# Task 3 - Use the # symbol to add your observations/generalizations as comments to your script
# Task 4 - Execute your script and compare the actual output to your predictions

##### Run ##### 

# NOTE: Run one line of code at a time (by commenting out the other lines of code above or below it)

print("Good morning!")

print("How are you?")

print('I am a student at Career Tech')

print('My favorite food is...')


##### Investigate ##### 

# Add your answers as comments below

# What would this line of code display on your screen? Print('The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog')

# What would happen if you executed the following code?: print("Greetings, Earthling! Take me to your leader!"

# And what would you see in your console if you executed this line of code?: Print("This is a string')


##### Modify ##### 

# Rewrite the three print statements from the Investigate section so that they display correctly
# in your console



##### Make ##### 
# Use what you've learned about the print ( ) function so far to display in your console two pieces of information -- 
# your full name and the name of the town/city you live in
